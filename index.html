                <p>
                    I am currently a transitioning veteran of the United States Marine Corps and an aspiring web developer. After serving almost nine years as a Communications Manager. I served in various billets such as Project Manager, Training and Development Manager, Communications Manager and Team Leader. I have had the opportunity to lead and serve with some of the finest people in the world and loved my time in the Marines. I am currently in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy(MSSA) learning Server and Cloud Administration but am doing my own independent learning with development. I have always had a love for technology since I was very young and want to continue that passion in the civilian work force. I am working towards a job in web development because that is where I have found my true passion.

                <h3 style="font-size: 48px">Experience</h3>
            <p>I have just under a year of experience working with development but have grown so much through my independent learning and projects. I am using as many tools for learning as I can and have went through a couple of periods of instruction given by my brother-in-law who is a Full Stack developer with 15 years experience. I am excited to get into development and web development to help clients and customers get what they want out of the site as well as help users get the experience they deserve. I am currently attending the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy going through Server and Cloud Administration to broaden my leaning in the tech community. I currently have 2 certifications which are the 70-740: Installation, Storage, and Compute with Windows Server 2016 and the 98-366: Networking Fundamentals.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 48px">Career Goals</h3>
                <p>My first main goal is to get a job as a junior developer in the Dayton or Cincinnati areas. I am aiming to work on a front-end development team to learn more about the designing and best practices for setting up the layout of web pages. Once I have had good experience there I want to move into back-end development and start working with applications. My goal is to be proficient in both within the next 1-2 years and continue learning about new technology that is always coming out. I pride myself by being the eternal student and trying to learn more and feel that this is the perfect career choice to do that in.  </p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 48px align="center">Military Experience</h3>
                <p>I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 2008 and attended boot camp in San Diego, California in 2009. From there I went to Marine Combat Training at Camp Pendleton, CA where i learned the basic combat skills needed for my future job. From there I went to Radio Operators Course and became an 0621 Field Radio Operator. Once my training was complete I went to the Fleet Marine Force and was stationed in Kaneohe Bay, HI. I was able to deploy multiple times while stationed with my first unit and learned valuable knowledge during my time there. After I completed my first enlistment I re-enlisted for another four years and moved to Camp Pendleton, CA where I spent the remainder of my time in the service. I was Meritoriously promoted to my current rank of Staff Sergeant while serving as a Combat Instructor at the School of Infantry.</p></img>
